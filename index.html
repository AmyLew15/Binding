                <h2>Design Perspective</h2>
                <p>These articles were originally published on AIGA's website. They discuss the importance of acknowledging other perspectives in the design field and how race, biases, and history have played a pivotal role in how design has developed. They question how we move forward in the design community to overcome the confines of a white majority based profession. It is also important to note, the articles have different solutions on how to appraoch this issue but overall emphasize the importance of community.</p>
