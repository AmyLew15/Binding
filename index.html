                <p>This site was created to showcase these articles that push for more diverse perspectives in the development of design norms. Each article discusses how race, biases, and privilege have played a pivotal role in how design has evolved in the digital age. They question how we choose to move forward in the design community to overcome the confines of what has been a white male majority profession. In design, much of the most notable and radical vehicles for change have come from designers who have used their skills in protest and emphasizing community. These articles argue that much of this same passion should be embedded into new teachings and methods of design practices to welcome more representation as the design world continues to grow.</p>
